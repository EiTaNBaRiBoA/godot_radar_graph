  Checkout the [demos](addons/godot_radar_graph/demos/).

  > All fonts are different! Be sure to use reliable font's to ensure the script works correctly.

> Customized using colors from the Godot Editor.

### Animation
  - All properties in the editor are keyable as well as Tween's. Although using `set(<property_name>)` is supported its still best to use the `set_item_` methods.
